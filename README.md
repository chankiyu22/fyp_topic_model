TOPIC MODELING PROJECT
==================
This is a final year project of HKUST.

This project will use Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to calculate the topics from [Yelp Datasets] (https://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge/). 

We will plan to produce a web page as well as a mobile app to retrive the results generate from this program.

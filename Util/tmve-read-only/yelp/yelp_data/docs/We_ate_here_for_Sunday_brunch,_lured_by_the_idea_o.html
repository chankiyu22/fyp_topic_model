                    We ate here for Sunday brunch, lured by the idea of red velvet and cinnamon buckwheat pancakes.  We managed to find parking close by and headed over.  We saw a large sign that said "Herb Box" up some stairs, with an inviting door, so we ventured inside.<br /><br /><br /><br />Upon entering, we were confused because we couldn't see a check in area.  Eventually, the hostess came by, gave us a dirty look, and said tersely "You didn't enter the right way.  This is the back way".  We were shown to a table after she bitchily asked us how many people we wanted a table for, but I was miffed that she was so annoyed at the fact we accidentally went in through the wrong entrance.  Looking at the sign when we left, there wasn't any indication that it was the back entrance, nor were there any instructions to enter through the front.  How were we supposed to know it wasn't the right way to enter?  Maybe they should put up a sign or some indication that this isn't the correct entrance (or lock the back door), wouldn't that clarify things a bit? (Or maybe the hostess shouldn't be so bitchy to customers?  Just a thought.)<br /><br /><br /><br />Despite being treated rudely by the hostess, our server was very friendly.  The red velvet pancakes were moist, chocolatey, and covered with a mild tasting mascarpone cheese.  The Gran Marnier sauce was delicious, and I could definitely taste the liquor in it!  I tried some of the cinnamon buckwheat pancakes, which were also very good.  The pancakes were very filling and a good portion size; I could only finish half of them because I got full halfway through my meal.<br /><br /><br /><br />In general, despite getting the cold shoulder initially, it was an enjoyable meal.  Since there are a plethora of breakfast places around this area though, I'd like to try some other restaurants here before maybe venturing to Herb Box again.

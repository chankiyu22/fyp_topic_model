                    Wow.  This was an experience and a half.<br /><br /><br /><br />I came here with the wifey in search of tacky christmas sweaters for a tacky christmas sweater party.  We certainly were not disappointed to this end.  The inventory and variety of tacky sweaters was outstanding.<br /><br /><br /><br />However, this place  is downright creepy.  We were two of maybe a handful of people in the place not on meth (including the employees).  How could I tell?  There were at least 8 instances of near-collisions with my cart and other carts/people just running around the store trying to burn off some meth-energy.  Methergy?  Look at that, I coined a new word.<br /><br /><br /><br />This place would be a dentist's nightmare.  I'm sure there were fewer collective teeth in all of walmart than the number of available tacky sweaters.<br /><br /><br /><br />There were unsupervised kids running amok EVERYWHERE.  One particular boy who couldn't have been older than 7 was climbing on a bunch of shelves on a display in the women's clothing section and was wearing a "Say NO to spitting tobacco" shirt.  Well I guess that's a good message, if not slightly odd.  There were lots of toddlers with crap all over their faces, as if they had just chowed down on some chocolate cake or something and then mom was like, "Ok, time to go to Walmart!" without bothering to wipe them off. <br /><br /><br /><br />One funny incident is worth repeating here.  In the grocery section (which I have to admit, is actually very well stocked) there was a display of Coca Cola bottles that were small and spherical in the shape of Christmas ornaments.  I remark "Wow those are cool" and a meth head behind me yells, "WOW!  THOSE ARE REALLY COOL" and then proceeds to try to get his wife's attention at the other end of Walmart to show her just how cool they were.  "SHEEEEEEEILA!  SHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEILA!  LOOK AT THIS!  LOOK!"<br /><br /><br /><br />It boggles my mind how the Target right around the corner from here is INFINITELY nicer than this Walmart.  Go there instead.  Unless you're looking for a tacky Christmas sweater.

                    We have had so many problems with this restaurant through the years.  We would stop going for a while and then decide to try it again.  Yesterday was our last try.<br /><br /><br /><br />This restaurant consistently has a problem with food temperature.  Yesterday my teriyaki chicken, baked potato, broccoli entree was lukewarm at best and the broccoli soggy (they are very hit and miss with the vegetables).  I stopped the rude waitress as she was flying by if they had a microwave.  She said "yes."  I asked her if she would take the plate and put it in the microwave for 30 seconds and she said "yes."  Next thing I know, I see her serving another table and then going to the bar and doing some work there.  I go up to her and ask where my plate of food is.  Soon, I see a man (I later learn he is the manager and could not believe it because he seemed more like a guy with the deer in the headlights look than a manager!) bringing a whole new plate of food to the table (he says it wasn't but I had already cut my chicken and had a piece and this was a new piece.  So, get this - this plate of food is COLDER than the first one and this was the manager of the restaurant serving it!  He seemed confused and befuddled.  I asked to have the entree removed from our bill.<br /><br /><br /><br />If this was the first time we had experienced problems here, we probably would have considered going back.  Through the years since this restaurant has opened, though, we have encountered cold food, frequently bad service and, sometimes, no service at all.  There was one visit where we sat at our table after being seated for 10 minutes on a quiet Monday at lunchtime and no server ventured even near us and we got up and left before having even been greeted.  No one seemed to care whether we were there or not.

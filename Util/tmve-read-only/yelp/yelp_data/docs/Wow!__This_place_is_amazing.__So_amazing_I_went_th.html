                    Wow!  This place is amazing.  So amazing I went there twice in a week.  I will start with my dinner.<br /><br /><br /><br />The ambiance was great.  The place has a nice warm feeling to it and since it was cold outside it was really nice.  They had a large fireplace inside and after dinner we stayed for the great crowd that showed up and went outside.  It was pretty chilly but I didn't even notice as the fire pit was big enough to warm everyone around it.  They also had ample heat lamps.  <br /><br /><br /><br />The food was fantastic.  I had the tomato soup with the grilled cheese crouton in it and it warmed me up and prepped me for my main meal.  I had the burger and tender belly bacon.  This was an amazing treat for my taste buds.  The bacon was not like any bacon I have had on a burger.  It was a perfect complement for each other.  I wanted another one when I was done but couldn't possibly eat anymore. <br /><br /><br /><br />The drinks were great.  They have an amazing wine selection.  The wines we were drinking were affordable and it looks like they really spent some time picking the right wines to carry.  They have some really nice wines that rival the selection of some of the really nice wine bars in Scottsdale as well.  My friends said that the mixed drinks were really well made and they were very happy with how they turned out.  They have just about everything you could want for mixed drinks.<br /><br /><br /><br />Service was amazing as well.  They were really attentive and the owner stopped by to talk to our table.  <br /><br /><br /><br />Lunch<br /><br /><br /><br />The lunch was just as good as the dinner.  I had a shrimp BLT that rivals anything in AZ.  I was glad to see that had a variety of Dr. Pepper/Mr. Pibb on tap.  It was really relaxing to sit there at lunch and enjoy the crowd.  The service was excellent.<br /><br /><br /><br />Overall I highly recommend Vintage 95 for lunch or dinner.  It is a great place for a date at night and you can enjoy the great crowd afterwards with great conversation and ambiance to fit.

                    Went with my parents who were visiting from out of town. I had never been but knew the location and thought it would be nice to see the view and walk around the resort after. The resort itself must be very beautiful when it is not undergoing a lot of construction. The website photos look stunning. Currently, however, many of the fountains were empty and construction barriers were up so we didn't get to enjoy the full visual effect. <br /><br />The restaurant itself though is beautiful, and huge! We went early so there was plenty of seating, and we got a nice booth by the wall. Our server was very nice and helped make a few wine suggestions for the three of us. <br /><br />The bread and olive oil at the beginning was standard. No interesting crackers or garlic cloves in the olive oil or anything.<br /><br />For entrees my dad ordered the gnocchi which he didn't finish....and he usually finishes everything.  My mom ordered the organic chicken which was a pretty big portion and she had enough to take home. I opted for the wild striped sea bass. I asked for it light on the oil/butter and our server informed me that it was cooked in parchment paper and essentially steamed so it would be lighter. I thought, oh that's great! However, when it arrived, there was a pool of oil at the bottom of the parchment paper. Bummer. <br /><br />It was a nicely cooked piece of fish, but again too oily and the artichoke hearts that accompanied it were either very dry on the outer leaves or could've had a few more leaves trimmed off. The mushrooms with it were very nice but it did not come with any spring onions, as the menu indicated.<br /><br />Our server tried to "sell us" some dessert after we mentioned we were full, but overall we did like him. <br /><br />We knew what the prices were like ahead of time,  but somehow, I don't feel like the food reflected the prices accurately.

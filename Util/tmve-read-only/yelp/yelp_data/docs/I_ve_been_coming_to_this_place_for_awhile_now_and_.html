                    I've been coming to this place for awhile now and this last experience has been so awful I am NEVER coming back!!!!<br /><br />I made a reservation for my husbands birthday for 12 people on a weds night in the bar area. We arrived to find out that they lost our reservation and we're told in a condescending manner that, "we don't take bar reservations".  We explained that we talked to Kevin and he double checked that the our reservation In the bar would be just fine. When I told manger/owner this, instead of apologizing and trying to rectify the situation, he acted as if we were out of line or lying about our reservation.  So then they shoved some tables awkwardly together and NEVER said sorry or that they were going to take care of us in any way.  I'm not sure why we stayed but we did, we were trying to have a good time for his birthday.. When the "incompetently obnoxious" server finally came over to get our drink/food order ,it was at least 5-10 mins. She took our order  and got everyone except myself.  She never asked me again if I was okay or if I was eating anything.  Long story short, it took forever and we waiting about 30 mins for our checks.. Speaking of split checks... Two couples in our group asked for separate checks because they had to leave early.  That wasn't a problem for them to get separate checks but when we asked for our checks to be split, she dropped off one check and told us to circle what we had!  We did so And of course she screwed it all up.  We also had a $25 gift card that surprisingly didn't work. They took the card and comped our bill. But really we paid $25 because they be we gave us a new gift card, (not like I'd ever come back).   Don't waste your time here!!!! The owner could give a shit about giving good service or making customers feel wanted.

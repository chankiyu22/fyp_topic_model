                    Visited Kazimierz on Monday, 11 June..  I was sitting in a local coffee shop studying some material for work but unfortunately the music was too loud to study..  My study partner came up with the ideal to go sit down at Kazimierz and study over a glass of wine..<br /><br />Here is my experience:<br /><br />When you first enter you are greeted by Jason; he checks your ID in order to make sure you are of legal drinking age.  I was really impressed with how professional Jason was.  Jason informed us that there was a $5 cover due to a band performing at 9pm.  The band had not started yet so he said that our cover could be refunded to us if we decided not to stay.  Jason also told us we could put our $5 cover on our wine tab as well.  He even recommended that we try the flatbread.  We sat down and our server brought us our wine menus.  Jeremy, our server, was great.  He was not at all a pretentious cork dork, something that most  sommelier's should note.  He helped us thru the list and understood that we needed to keep a low price point..  I give Jeremy 5 stars for his cool vibe and professionalism.  <br /><br />Unfortunately kazimierz is not the place to study a book, I was pretty close to just giving up on the studying and just enjoying myself, but duty calls.  Due to the awesome service and laid back atmosphere I can't wait to go back.. <br /><br />Random Advice for Kazimierz(not that they asked):<br /><br />It was a little confusing when Jason explained the cover.. It would be much more simple if you said something like this, "A $5 cover per guest will be added to your check if you stay past 9pm(Which is when our band starts.)". Just saying, it's simple, I wouldn't have to decide if I should give my cover to the doorman or the server and it helps the doorman keep track of who has paid, if somebody did not start a tab then you would just tell them to keep their receipt that shows they paid the cover.  I know it may not seem like a big deal but you guys seem detail oriented and it is all about the details for most patrons.  Sorry if I have come across eccentric but you would have to know me to understand..  I have worked in the industry for a while and I love it when I see a restaurant that gets it right.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Kazimierz and I can't wait to get back in there.<br /><br />Regards,<br /><br />-Joel

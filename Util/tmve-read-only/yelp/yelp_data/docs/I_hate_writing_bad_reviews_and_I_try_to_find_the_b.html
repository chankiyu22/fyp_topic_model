                    I hate writing bad reviews and I try to find the best in the places I go to. There were just too many problems with our brunch at North. The best way for me to explain the 2 stars is to give you a breakdown of our experience. <br /><br /><br /><br />We arrived at North and right away I have to say that I liked the look of the place. Very cool barn design with tons of windows and a bar that is very inviting. Well things changed as soon as we went in. First off the place was maybe 30% full so there was a ton of seating. We were shocked to hear that there was a 15 minute wait. Now I know a little about the restaurant business and it could have very well been that they were short staffed. I still think it is a much better experience for people to be seated and explain your situation. <br /><br /><br /><br />While we were waiting outside I decided to go to the bar to get some coffee for us. The bartender didn't acknowledge me and instead decided to help the people that came in after me. I moved down the bar hoping it was because she didn't see me. Well that wasn't it because I got another 5 minutes of her avoiding me like I was Kris Humphries at a Kardashian family reunion. <br /><br /><br /><br />Finally she took my order to which she tried having two other people fulfill it. Needless to say we were seated before I even got the coffee. Bad service.<br /><br /><br /><br />Once we were seated things seemed to get better. We had a very nice waiter and he was very quick with getting us drinks and our order. When the food arrived things went downhill again. <br /><br /><br /><br />My girlfriends eggs were so salty her blood pressure went from 110/60 to 180/120. She only had one bite. Her oatmeal was also missing apples which was a big part of it. She was very disappointed. Mine wasn't much better. My breakfast sandwich is something I could make at home. Very plain roll with overcooked fried egg and two skinny pieces of bacon.  The potatoes were fantastic though. Odd they give you a thick aioli that ruins the potato. Just avoid it.<br /><br /><br /><br />I can only review this place on its brunch. I haven't been here for dinner and not really sure I will give it another try. The service from the bartender and the very sub-par food makes me want to spend my money elsewhere. There are too many great restaurants in Phoenix that appreciate the business.

                    i'm a former resident, i lived at this property for 3 years. for the first 2 years, i lived in an upstairs unit, facing west. i liked the unit and the price 940 sq ft for about $800 with pet rent, water/sewer and taxes. not too bad.<br /><br />however, this unit had zero insulation. the temperature in the living room could be anywhere from 5 to 15 degrees different than the master bedroom. the doors didn't line up right with the door jambs and the windows are single pane.  talk about a giant electric bill!<br /><br /><br /><br />the year i lived downstairs was a nightmare from start to finish. i LOVED my unit, 2 bed, 2 bath 960 sq ft for about $800 all said and done. however, the first month a washer line broke and flooded my apartment. i asked maintenance when the last time they were replaced was and the man replied, "we don't keep track of minor things like that". uh, ok. i have a $6000 dry cleaning bill that says this is not minor! thankfully i had renter's insurance and that was covered. i did get a brand new washer and dryer for my unit, though.<br /><br /><br /><br />the downstairs units are horrid for one major reason. if anyone above you is more than 75 pounds, you're going to hear every step they take. i mean EVERY step. you may be so lucky as to hear their morning "business" and them taking a shower. oh and my favorite, i could hear the chairs/bed creaking every time they sat/laid down or got up.  i could be laying in my bed and watch my ceiling DIP and the ceiling fan MOVE (when it was not on) when these tenants walked/stomped across their floor.<br /><br /><br /><br />upon moving out, i was charged $250 for carpet replacement due to "heavy pet staining". i was livid. i called the manager and told her that the only stains on that carpet were from 2 soda spills and one spaghetti mishap. the contracted carpet company will probably try to replace every time a tenant moves out. bad business!<br /><br />most of the office staff is...ok. the one saving grace this property has is the manager, Erica. she is very, very nice and helpful. she helped me work out the erroneous charge for the carpet and i did get my entire (giant) security deposit back.<br /><br /><br /><br />if you're planning on moving here, get an east facing upstairs unit, because you'll hate life and your electric bill otherwise.

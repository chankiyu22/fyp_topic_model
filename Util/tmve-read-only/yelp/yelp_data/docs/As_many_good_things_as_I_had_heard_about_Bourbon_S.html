                    As many good things as I had heard about Bourbon Steak, I couldn't bring myself to try it when their prices make even Mastro's look reasonable. However, during the summer, they run a special $39 3-course Summer Menu that is a terrific value. They don't offer it automatically, though, so be sure to request it.<br /><br /><br /><br />The restaurant is situated in the beautiful Fairmont Princess - valet is complimentary. The space is the steakhouse modernized - dark tones, warm lighting, top-40 and rock music. The service is terrific, from the hostess to the server to the GM. And the food is Michael Mina great. For a chef who has developed quite a large collection of restaurants across the country, his places never disappoint.<br /><br /><br /><br />Bourbon Steak begins your meal with a trio of duckfat fries, "compliments of the chef." This is the Holy Trinity of fries...true perfection, and far better a start to a meal than any bread could be, although they also brought us black truffle potato bread that was excellent. I can't speak to any of the dishes on the regular menu, but if you decide to try the Summer Menu, I highly recommend the date and mozzarella appetizer. We also had the calamari app, but it was a little disappointing - the jalape\u00f1o poppers it's served with were delicious, and the dipping sauce was great, but the calamari batter was a bit soggy. For entrees, both the short rib and the skirt steak were terrific - tender and flavorful, with not a bit of fat. I'd say the short rib was the slight favorite of the two. And I can only imagine how crazy good the chicken mac 'n' cheese is, but it seemed a little too indulgent for such a big meal. Finally, both of the desserts - the passion fruit panna cotta and the Greek yogurt parfait - were fantastic. The perfect light and refreshing ending to the meal. If you're only getting one, it just depends on whether you like something a little more tart (the panna cotta) or sweeter (the parfait).<br /><br /><br /><br />I'm thrilled they have this summer deal to allow diners who might otherwise be frightened off by the prices to give them a try. While I probably won't be back anytime soon without a corporate expense account, I'd say Bourbon Steak should be up there with Mastro's and J&G (which, of the three, is the best value, IMO) as the Valley's finest steakhouses.

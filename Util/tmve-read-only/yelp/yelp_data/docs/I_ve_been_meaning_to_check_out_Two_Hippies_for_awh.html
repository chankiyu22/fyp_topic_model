                    I've been meaning to check out Two Hippies for awhile since it's a convenient stop on my daily lunchtime commute.  Today was one of those "...I have $5.00 and no lunch.  What can I do with that?" days when I remembered the $5.00 lunch special at Two Hippies and decided to give it a shot.<br /><br /><br /><br />The first thing to catch my eye was the height of the counters on the front porch. At 5'2 there is absolutely no way I would be able to sit on the stool and eat lunch.  It just isn't physically possible without more leaping, climbing, and stretching than I'm willing to do for a burger.<br /><br /><br /><br />Once I entered the shop, I realized that the indoor counters were just as unapproachable.  As I began peeking at the printed menu, a kid eleven or twelve years old greeted me and asked if this was my first time visiting.  Initially I wondered why he wasn't in school, then seconds later I realized that there's this whole summer vacation thing...  The kid was far more professional and polite during our entire encounter than most adults.  He explained the specials, answered my questions, and was a general sweetheart.  He alone deserves a couple of gold stars.<br /><br /><br /><br />I ordered a cheeseburger, lettuce only, fries, and a can of soda for an even $5.00.  I'm not much of a soda fan, but somehow the charm of this brown bag lunch won me over.  After about a quarter of the can of Coke, however, I chucked it in the trash and remembered that I don't actually like soda.<br /><br /><br /><br />The fries, as mentioned in previous reviews, were well seasoned but a soggy sort.  It's a rare day I want fries, anyway, and will definitely give the onion rings a shot at my second visit.  The burger also had an interesting seasoning that slowly grew on me.  The bun on the burger was awesome and I'll definitely be back.<br /><br /><br /><br />There is a small patio on the back with a wooden counter and benches built in.  These are a reasonable height and perfectly acceptable to eat a quick lunch while reading a book.  While I was back there, the couple behind the counter stepped out to briefly check in to make sure everything was okay. It was a nice touch.<br /><br /><br /><br />UPDATE:  My one issue is now the salt.  The onion rings were salty to the point of being inedible, and I'm no saltphobic.  If they'd cut back by half (or 75%, preferrably), they would be fantastic.  It's easy to add salt, but impossible to remove it.  Even the last two burgers there have been too salty.

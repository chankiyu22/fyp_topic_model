                    We knew it was opening up-- we watched and waited for it to arrive, and finally it did!  a Thai restaurant in our neighborhood!  we were psyched to find out Papaya Thai had an excellent rep and following already from it's East Mesa location, and we were happy to try it-- open on Easter, yay!  the owners are very friendly and showed us around the place.  there is a raised platform in the middle of the restaurant that has cute little booths separated by curtains-- this could be great for a romantic evening-- there are also regular booths as well.  this was only the second day they have been open, we found out.  I am always a sucker for an aquarium, and they have a nice one.  Wife is a curry fan, ordered the Pa Nang and was very impressed.  Not for nothing did this place earn a "Best Curry in Phoenix" award.  I even loved it, and I don't NORMALLY get that excited about curry.  my exact quote upon trying the curry sauce was, "I could drink this stuff as a beverage!" I ordered Drunken Noodles, medium, which was great and the perfect amount of spice for me (they also serve Mild,  "Hot", and "Thai Hot").  also nice was the crab fried rice.  the Crab puffs were not that great, and seemed to have no crab in them.  I think the lady tried to tell us that, though, and we just didn't understand what she was saying.    we also got a free eggroll which was terrific.  Tom Yum soup was nice and cilantro-y.  We love this place, please patronize it!  I'm already planning my next meal!  They have weekday lunch specials and you can get food to go.

                    I was expecting much more from Fresh & Easy. With all the hype about how wonderfully fresh and quick it was, I was expecting more. I couldn't find one damn package of broccoli florets that didn't have yellowing around the ends. Whatever. I bought it anyway, hoping it wouldn't taste bitter. Surprise, surprise...I got it home and it was disgusting. I should have known.<br /><br /><br /><br />I went to their section for pre packaged meals and was let down. For a store that's wanting to cater to the hip, environemental, organic, healthy crowd, almost everything they sold had Canola oil in it. Dude, vegetable oils are disgusting and highly processed. Like everything had canola oil in it and that shows me they are  c-h-e-a-p  asses in production. <br /><br /><br /><br />Secondly out of about 60 prepackaged meals, only 2 were allergen free. Everything pre packaged had at least one of the top allergens as ingredients, but most of them had 2 or 3! WTF? Can't I get one thing without wheat, eggs, dairy, nuts, or soy? Let alone like have all of them in the meal? That rules out a lot of people to buy they're supposedly "fresh and easy" meals. That was a major let down. I bought some mexican chicken stuff which was pretty good, and cheap, so I'll give it that.<br /><br /><br /><br />I didn't realize they were trying to be environmentally friendly although I did notice the lack of paper bags, and only saw plastic. Maybe I was missing the paper somewhere? It didn't live up to my expectations and it's no wonder it's not doing as well in the United States as Tesco Lotus had hoped. <br /><br /><br /><br />Honestly, Trader Joes has WAY better pre packaged, fresher items, both produce wise and for heat-up meals on the go. I'd rather just go there to pick up a meal, and skip this whole charade.<br /><br /><br /><br />I'll try it again because there's one right around the corner from me, and I'd like to see if any of their other stuff is worth buying.
